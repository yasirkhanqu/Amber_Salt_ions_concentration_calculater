# Amber_Salt_ions_concentration_calculater

This code calculates the number of ions to be added to an amber system based on the salt concentration you want in you system. 

Example: Consider the example shown at amber official page Link: https://ambermd.org/tutorials/basic/tutorial8/index.php and you want to calculate the number of ions for this system to match physiological condition. Run this code, it will ask for volume in Å3, enter the value as 208141.839 Å3 and set the salt concentratyion to 0.150mol/l. It will calculate the number of ions.

Note: These number of ions will be aditional to the number of ions you add for neutralizing the system.
