# Amber_salt_ions_concentration_calculater

This code calculates the number of ions to be added to an amber system based on the salt concentration you want in your system. 

Example: Consider the example shown on the amber official page Link: https://ambermd.org/tutorials/basic/tutorial8/index.php you want to calculate the number of ions for this system to match physiological conditions. 

Run this code, it will ask for volume in Å3, enter the value as 208141.839 Å3 and set the salt concentration to 0.150mol/l. It will calculate the number of NA and Cl ions.

Note: These ions will be added to the number of ions you add to neutralise the system.
